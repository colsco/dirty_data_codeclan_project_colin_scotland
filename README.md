CodeClan Dirty Data project

The "dirty data" project is an introduction to messy data, 
with the aim being to handle it in such a way that the resulting 
"clean data" can be used for some analysis.

The file structure consists of two tasks; task3 and task4.

Task 3 is an analysis of bird sightings.

Task 4 is an analysis of halloween candy.

Both tasks are structured as follows;

'clean_data' -> containing cleaned data as .csv documents.
'data_cleaning_scripts' -> where the R scripts are located.
'documentation_and_analysis' -> containing .html outputs and RMarkdown files
'raw_data' -> where the raw data files are located.

.Rproj files are located in the task top level directories.
